  <h1>My Chosen Civic Engagement Topic</h1>
  
  <body>
    <h2>Introducing My Topic</h2>
    <p>When it comes to the question, is it ethical for someone to take an attitude that they do not need to know anything about the internal details of a machine because someone else will build it, maintain it, and fix any problems that arise? The answer is somewhat complicated.</p>
    
    <h2>Basic Information About My Topic</h2>
    <p>Let’s start by considering a relatively simple machine, such as a toaster. The average person does not typically have the knowledge to build or repair a toaster, nor do they need to. Toasters are designed to be simple and user friendly, and most people can operate them without a deep understanding of their internal mechanics. In this case, it is reasonable to say that it is not unethical for someone to use the toaster without knowing how it works, because the potential consequences of failure are minimal. If the toaster breaks, it is unlikely to cause harm beyond inconvenience, and a professional repair man can handle the necessary fixes. This situation changes, however, when we shift our focus to more complex and potentially dangerous machines, such as a nuclear power plant. In this case, if you work at the plant, it is absolutely necessary to have a comprehensive understanding of the inner workings of the system. A nuclear power plant is a highly intricate and sensitive machine, and the consequences of failure or malfunction can be catastrophic. Unlike a toaster, where the worst-case scenario might involve burnt toast or at worst a fire, a problem at a nuclear power plant could lead to widespread environmental damage, loss of life, or long-term health consequences for entire communities. So, it is not just unethical but irresponsible for someone working in such a setting to adopt the attitude of relying on others to manage the machine. Those employed in such environments must possess a deep knowledge of the machinery, its upkeep, and how to troubleshoot and resolve issues as they arise. The safety and well-being of the public are at stake, and any failure to take responsibility for understanding the machine could have disastrous results. This principle of responsibility extends beyond just industrial or high-stakes settings. In any scenario where the machine or technology has the potential to significantly impact human life, the individual’s role in understanding its mechanics becomes critical. For example, doctors and healthcare professionals rely on medical equipment that can diagnose and treat patients. A failure to understand how these devices work whether it's a ventilator, or a diagnostic scanner could result in incorrect usage, misdiagnosis, or harm to patients. Just as with nuclear power plants, the stakes in healthcare are high, and professionals must understand the machinery to ensure it functions properly and safely.</p>
    
    <h2>Discourse Surrounding My Topic</h2>
    <p>In the source “Ethical dilemmas” they talk about why machines cant be ethical. They say that machines are flawed and have limited utility in confronting Ethics. They say that only creatures with bodies with expressive abilities can experience ethical problems and that our problems should not be outsourced to machines. So they are saying that our issues are our own and that we need to take responsibility for them and not leave them up to machines.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>In conclusion, whether it is ethical to adopt an attitude of not needing to know the details of a machine depends heavily on the context. For everyday household appliances like toasters, such an attitude may be acceptable, but for more complex and potentially dangerous machines, especially in fields where human safety and the environment are at risk, it becomes ethically imperative for individuals to understand the machinery they work with. Ultimately, the ethical responsibility rests with humans, as machines cannot make moral judgments or take accountability for their actions.</p>
