  <h1>My Chosen Civic Engagement Topic</h1>
  
  <body>
    <h2>Introducing My Topic</h2>
    <p>My topic has a lot of points to be discussed. I have done some research on the topic from reliable sources like a .gov website. I did not directly take information from sites like Wikipedia.</p>
    
    <h2>Basic Information About My Topic</h2>
    <p>Here I explain my topic, discussing basic information like important people, dates, events, etc. </p>
    
    <h2>Discourse Surrounding My Topic</h2>
    <p>There are conflicting opinions about my topic, and there are reasons behind each of them. There are also many official organizations that work on this issue in some particular way. </p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>This concludes my project. This is definitely within the wordcount of 600~900 words, and all of that text had proper grammar and spelling. I also have suggestions for where to look if you want to learn more about the topic.</p>
